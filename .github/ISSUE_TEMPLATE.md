**Important**: The following content applies if you are already using the AWS Mobile CLI to configure your backend. 
If you are building a new mobile or web app, or you're adding cloud capabilities to your existing app, use the new 
[AWS Amplify CLI](http://aws-amplify.github.io/) instead. With the new Amplify CLI, you can use all of the features 
described in [Announcing the AWS Amplify CLI toolchain](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-the-aws-amplify-cli-toolchain/), including AWS CloudFormation functionality that provides additional workflows.
